# ServiceFlow: Use Cases

This document outlines the strategic value of ServiceFlow for specific user groups in the hospitality industry. It contrasts traditional training methods with the AI-driven ServiceFlow approach to highlight efficiency, consistency, and accessibility.

## 1. User Personas

### A. The General Manager (GM) / Owner
*   **Profile:** Extremely busy, spends 90% of time on the floor or handling crises. Dislikes sitting at a computer to type documents.
*   **Pain Point:** "I know how things *should* be done, but I don't have time to write the manual. When I leave the room, standards drop."
*   **ServiceFlow Value:** Allows them to capture standards verbally while walking the floor, instantly creating permanent assets.

### B. The Corporate Trainer / Operations Director
*   **Profile:** Responsible for 5+ locations. Needs standardization. Frustrated by "Tribal Knowledge" (where one location does it differently than another).
*   **Pain Point:** "I can't be at every store every day. I send emails with instructions, but nobody reads them."
*   **ServiceFlow Value:** Creates uniform, visual, and branded training packs that can be distributed instantly to all units.

### C. The Front-of-House (FOH) Staff (Servers, Hosts, Bartenders)
*   **Profile:** Young, mobile-first, visual learners. Often part-time. High turnover rate.
*   **Pain Point:** "The training binder is dusty and boring. I forgot what the manager said in pre-shift lineup because it was loud."
*   **ServiceFlow Value:** Bite-sized, mobile-friendly cards and audio clips they can review on their phone before a shift.

## 2. Core Scenarios & Solution Analysis

### Scenario 1: The Seasonal Menu Launch
**Context:** A restaurant changes its menu 4 times a year. The Chef knows the dishes, but the servers need to sell them.

*   **The Traditional Way:**
    *   The Chef yells descriptions during a loud pre-shift meeting.
    *   Servers scribble messy notes on napkins.
    *   **Result:** Inconsistent descriptions. Servers say "It's a fish dish" instead of "It's a Pan-Seared Halibut with a Miso Glaze."

*   **The ServiceFlow Way (Audio Script & Guide):**
    *   **Action:** The Chef takes a photo of the dish and records a 30-second voice note describing the ingredients and the "romance" language.
    *   **App Solution:** ServiceFlow generates a **Script Card** (text) and an **Audio Training** clip (Native Audio).
    *   **Value:** Every server listens to the *perfect* description. The description is standardized, professional, and accessible 24/7.

### Scenario 2: The Large Event Setup
**Context:** A hotel ballroom needs to be set up for a wedding with a specific, non-standard floor plan.

*   **The Traditional Way:**
    *   The Event Manager draws a rough sketch on a piece of paper and tapes it to the wall.
    *   Staff misinterpret the sketch. Tables are placed too close to fire exits.
    *   **Result:** Manager has to physically move tables themselves 30 minutes before guests arrive. Panic.

*   **The ServiceFlow Way (Layout Diagram):**
    *   **Action:** The Manager types: "Ballroom A. 20 round tables in a 4x5 grid. Head table on the North Wall. Buffet on the East Wall."
    *   **App Solution:** ServiceFlow utilizes the Visual Coder agent to generate a precise **HTML/Mermaid Diagram**.
    *   **Value:** A clean, scaled, digital map that can be printed or viewed on tablets. No ambiguity.

### Scenario 3: Standardizing "The Perfect Pour"
**Context:** A high-end bar requires a specific 7-step ritual for pouring wine (present label, cut foil, wipe rim, etc.).

*   **The Traditional Way:**
    *   "Shadowing." A new hire follows a senior bartender for 3 days.
    *   **Result:** The "Game of Telephone." If the senior bartender has bad habits (e.g., forgetting to wipe the rim), the new hire learns those bad habits. Standards degrade over time.

*   **The ServiceFlow Way (Sequence Cards):**
    *   **Action:** The Bar Manager uploads a quick video of the perfect pour or narrates the steps.
    *   **App Solution:** ServiceFlow creates **Service Sequence Cards**. It breaks the process into 7 distinct steps, creating a generated illustration (Nano Banana) for each step.
    *   **Value:** Visual SOPs that establish a "Golden Standard" independent of who is doing the training.

### Scenario 4: Handling an Intoxicated Guest
**Context:** A difficult, high-liability situation that requires strict adherence to legal and safety protocols.

*   **The Traditional Way:**
    *   A dense text document in an employee handbook tucked away in the office.
    *   **Result:** In the heat of the moment, staff panic and act emotionally rather than logically.

*   **The ServiceFlow Way (Flowchart):**
    *   **Action:** Manager inputs the legal policy text.
    *   **App Solution:** ServiceFlow generates a **Problem Resolution Flowchart**.
    *   **Logic:** "Is guest slurring? -> Yes -> Offer Water -> Do they refuse? -> Yes -> Get Manager."
    *   **Value:** Logic-based training that simplifies complex decision-making into a visual map.
